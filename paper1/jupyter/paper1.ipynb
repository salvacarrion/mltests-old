    "- The results from es-en and pt-en are pretty similar across all tested domains. Therefore, the comments below can apply to both of them.\n",
    "- **Health model:** This model is trained on the health domain exclusively. However, this case is interesting since we expect the health model to perform very well on its domain (health), then to perform reasonably well on the merged domain (as there is more data), and finally, to perform worse on the biology domain. However, the health model performs very well in all domains with no significant differences among them. We argue that this could be related to the amount of data available for each domain. The training set from the health domain contains around ~550k sentences, while the biological domain has only 100k sentences. This imbalance in terms of data could lead to inadvertively train more performant models when using the health domain. To test this hyphotesis, we have trained a new model but using the same amount of data as it is available for the biological domain (later).\n",

    "- **Health+Biology:** This model is trained on the health and biological domain at once. Here, we observed a consistent increase in performance for all domains. As the amount of data in the biology domain is significantly smaller than the health domain, the improvements are only slightly better than the health domain.\n",
    "- **Health->Biology:** This model is trained sequentially. First on the health domain, and then fine-tuned on the biological domain. As a result of this sequential training, the performance in the fine-tuned domain increased but at expense of worsen its performance on a previously learned domain (health). This phenomenon is known as \"catastrophic forgetting\" and it is the one we will try to mitigate."
